# r/Sciences Post Classification with Interpretability

In this project I have created text classification models to classify Reddit posts  according to their topics. I use Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations ([lime](https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) to generate explanations for the predictions.

[r/Sciences](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/) subreddit is a great community to share and discuss new scientific research and read about the latest advances in astronomy, biology, medicine, physics, social science, and more.

For more details please see the [Notebook](https://github.com/SatenikS/reddit-text-classification/blob/main/reddit-science.ipynb).
